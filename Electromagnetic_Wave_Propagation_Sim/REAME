START

1. Initialize a 2D grid for electric and magnetic fields.
2. Define parameters such as time step (dt), grid spacing (dx), and number of iterations.

3. FUNCTION update_electric_field(E, B, dt, dx)
    - Use finite differences to calculate the new electric field values based on the magnetic field.

4. FUNCTION update_magnetic_field(B, E, dt, dx)
    - Use finite differences to calculate the new magnetic field values based on the electric field.

5. MULTITHREADING:
    - Launch threads to update both electric and magnetic fields in parallel.
    - Use mutexes to avoid race conditions during field updates.

6. FUNCTION main()
    - Initialize electric and magnetic fields.
    - Launch the multithreaded FDTD solver.
    - Measure performance using chrono.
