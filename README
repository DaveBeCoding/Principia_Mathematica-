Example Problem 1: (Use case-1 FDTD)

Problem:

- In embedded systems, especially those that involve wireless communication (e.g., IoT devices, mobile phones, or military drones), the design of the antenna is crucial for signal transmission and reception. Antennas need to be efficient in propagating electromagnetic waves with minimal losses, and their performance can be impacted by nearby components and the device’s casing.

FDTD Approach: 

The FDTD method can be used to simulate how an antenna’s electromagnetic waves propagate in space, and how they are influenced by nearby objects or materials. This helps optimize the design for better signal strength and reduced interference.

How FDTD Solves It:

	1.	Set Up the Grid: The simulation grid represents the space around the antenna.
	2.	Design the Antenna: Define the antenna geometry and its material properties.
	3.	Simulate Signal Propagation: Simulate the electric and magnetic fields emitted by the antenna using the FDTD method.
	4.	Optimize the Design: Adjust the antenna design or position to maximize efficiency and minimize signal loss or interference.


Example Problem 2: (Use case-2 FDTD)

Problem:

In cybersecurity, particularly in hardware security, devices can leak electromagnetic (EM) emissions during operation. These emissions can be captured by attackers using side-channel attacks to recover sensitive information (e.g., encryption keys). Protecting devices from these attacks is crucial in secure communications and military applications.

FDTD Approach:

The FDTD method can simulate the electromagnetic emissions from a device under various conditions. By understanding where and how the emissions occur, engineers can design shielding mechanisms or modify device architecture to minimize these leaks.

How FDTD Solves It:

	1.	Model the Device: Simulate the internal architecture of the device, including CPUs, memory, and power circuits.
	2.	Simulate EM Emissions: Use FDTD to simulate the electromagnetic emissions generated by the device during computation (e.g., during cryptographic operations).
	3.	Design Countermeasures: Analyze the emissions and design shielding or architectural modifications to minimize the detectable signals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this simulation, you are solving Maxwell’s equations using the FDTD method. These equations describe how electromagnetic fields (electric  \mathbf{E}  and magnetic  \mathbf{B} ) propagate through space and time. 
This is critical in telecommunications, radar systems, antenna design, and secure communication systems

Here’s what’s happening under the hood:

	•	The FDTD method discretizes space and time into small intervals.
	•	The simulation computes the electric field at each point on a grid, followed by the magnetic field.
	•	These calculations are based on finite-difference approximations of the partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from Maxwell’s equations.
	•	Parallelism is introduced using multithreading, meaning that separate threads are updating the electric and magnetic fields concurrently to improve efficiency. The use of mutexes ensures that there are no race conditions between these threads.

The performance measurement using chrono is vital to determine the efficiency of the simulation for larger grid sizes and more iterations, which would be crucial in real-world applications.

3. Mathematical Importance of the Project

	•	Maxwell’s Equations are the foundation of electromagnetic theory. The ability to numerically solve them is a fundamental skill for any engineer working with wave propagation, electromagnetic interference, or wireless communication.
	•	The finite-difference method approximates the continuous behavior of fields in discrete steps. This is necessary for real-world simulations, where exact analytical solutions are often impossible.
Example of a finite difference for the electric field:

\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial t} \approx \frac{E_x^{n+1} - E_x^n}{\Delta t}

This tells us how the electric field changes over time, and similar equations exist for spatial derivatives.
	•	Parallel Computing: By using multithreading, we can run portions of the computation simultaneously, which is essential for large-scale simulations involving millions of grid points (such as radar wave propagation or secure communication systems).
	•	The reason for the small time intervals you see in the output (e.g., 8.4333e-05 seconds) is that each time step represents a small “slice” of the total simulation, and updating a large grid can be computationally expensive without parallelism.
